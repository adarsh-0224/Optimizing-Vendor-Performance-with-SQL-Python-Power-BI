1. Project Title : Vendor Performance Analysis using SQL, Python (EDA), and Power BI

2. Short Description / Purpose  
This project focuses on analyzing vendor performance to optimize procurement and supply chain decisions.  
Key metrics such as spend, fill rate, on-time delivery, and cost analysis are derived from purchase order data.  
The insights help businesses identify top-performing vendors, reduce risks, and improve efficiency.


3. Tech Stack  
- SQL (MySQL) : Data cleaning, schema creation, and queries for spend/fill rate analysis  
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization  
- Power BI : Interactive dashboards and KPI tracking  
- Excel/CSV : Data storage and preprocessing


4. Data Source  
- Synthetic datasets created for vendor, items, and purchase orders
  - vendor_master.csv
  - item_master.csv
  - vendor_purchase_orders.csv
- These files were cleaned and structured in MySQL for analysis.  


5. Features / Highlights  
- Data Cleaning & Preparation : Schema design, column type fixes, constraints, and relationships in MySQL  
- SQL Analysis : Vendor spend, fill rate %, average unit cost, and top vendors by spend  
- Python EDA : Data summaries, vendor/category trends, and statistical insights  
  - Power BI Dashboard :
  - Vendor spend by year and category  
  - Fill rate % by vendor  
  - On-time delivery %  
  - KPIs: Spend, Fill Rate, Quantity Ordered/Received  
- Final Report: Insights, business interpretation, and recommendations
