1. Project Title : Vendor Performance Analysis using SQL, Python (EDA), and Power BI

2. Short Description / Purpose  
This project focuses on analyzing vendor performance to optimize procurement and supply chain decisions.  
Key metrics such as spend, fill rate, on-time delivery, and cost analysis are derived from purchase order data.  
The insights help businesses identify top-performing vendors, reduce risks, and improve efficiency.


3. Tech Stack  
SQL (MySQL) : Data cleaning, schema creation, joins, and analytical queries  
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and insights  
Power BI : Dashboard creation, KPIs, slicers, and advanced data visualization  
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) : Custom measures and KPIs in Power BI  
Data Modeling : Relationships between Vendor, Item, and Orders tables

  File Formats Used :  
  - .csv : Cleaned datasets (vendor, item, orders)  
  - .sql : SQL queries and schema definitions  
  - .ipynb : Python Jupyter Notebook (EDA)  
  - .pbix : Power BI Dashboard file  
  - .pdf : Project report & presentation


4. Data Source  
- Synthetic datasets created for vendor, items, and purchase orders
  - vendor_master.csv
  - item_master.csv
  - vendor_purchase_orders.csv
- These files were cleaned and structured in MySQL for analysis.  


5. Features / Highlights  
- Data Cleaning & Preparation : Schema design, column type fixes, constraints, and relationships in MySQL  
- SQL Analysis : Vendor spend, fill rate %, average unit cost, and top vendors by spend  
- Python EDA : Data summaries, vendor/category trends, and statistical insights  
  - Power BI Dashboard :
  - Vendor spend by year and category  
  - Fill rate % by vendor  
  - On-time delivery %  
  - KPIs: Spend, Fill Rate, Quantity Ordered/Received  
- Final Report: Insights, business interpretation, and recommendations
